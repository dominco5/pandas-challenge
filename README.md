PANDAS CHALLENGE

In this assignment, we looked at all of the information we learned about Pandas, DataFrames, and series. 

From the two CSV files we were provided, we converted both into DataFrames and merged them to get information about each student. We then created various summary tables using GroupBy objects and various aggregate functions, looking at schools' performance based on test scores and the scores' relation to school spending, size, and type.
